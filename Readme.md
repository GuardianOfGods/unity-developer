üëã **Hi there, I'm HoangVanThu**. I am currently a mobile Unity developer at a Vietnamese company. I have many years of experience in the field and I want to share what I know with everyone. 

This repository is mostly for reference, it contains the tips and tricks I have applied throughout my programming career. I hope you find it useful.

## Unity Hub
### Trouble With Liscenses
- Occasionally, adding a license in Unity Hub gets interrupted even though you have clicked to add it. My advice in this situation is to be patient and wait for a while, or you can repeatedly perform the add license action until it succeeds.

### Chose Unity Version
- First, always choose Unity versions with **LTS (Long Term Support)** to minimize errors and receive bug fixes from Unity in subsequent LTS versions.

> [!WARNING] 
> I frequently have build errors in **Xcode (iOS environment)** due to thread conflicts and library conflicts between third-party services such as Firebase, Admob, AppLovin, etc. In some cases, I have had to upgrade or downgrade Unity versions for the issue to be resolved (Unity also provides release notes to fix these errors).
